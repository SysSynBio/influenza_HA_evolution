The tips of the tree:siteTree were matched with the species names from the data as follows {39,73,34,52,64,27,47,50,56,31,0,12,44,46,16,32,36,48,15,37,67,17,20,28,35,62,68,24,69,65,42,43,19,79,66,76,54,51,55,25,18,61,33,13,81,78,29,9,38,80,7,63,30,40,23,49,2,6,71,14,41,5,21,58,75,22,57,1,3,59,60,10,53,11,26,70,77,8,4,72,45,74}
Partition  reversible model flag computed as 1
