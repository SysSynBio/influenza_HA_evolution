influenza_HA_evolution
======================
analysis - Contains all most of the scripts for final analysis and plots (using the numbering_table data) including the network graphs and the paneled plots.
data_table - Contains the numbering_table file which contains all of the important data for the final plots.
distance_plots - Contains the structures and information to do all of the structural plots.
epitope_data - Contains all of the epitope data from the FluDB, the alignments, the counts, and the scripts for that analysis.
frequency_shift - Not relevant to the manuscript.  Contains a currently broken, brief, and slightly different implementation of the Shih and Li paper.
Papers - Contains all of the papers that seemed compositionally relevant to this project.  It is missing some that I found toward the end.
sequence_data - Contains all of the initial sequence and structure data.  The sequences are separated into folders by year where year 1 is the 1991-1992 flu season. Combined contains the actual analysis used in the manuscript.  Structure contains the actual scripts used to produce the data for the distance plots.
